# Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)

In the healthcare system, there are always opportunities to optimize, streamline, develop and test processes. Quality improvement (QI) is a proven, effective way to improve care for patients, residents, and clients, and improve practice for staff[1]. QI utilizes structured improvement methods and models, such as Model for Improvement and a testing model called Plan-Do-Study-Act[2] (PDSA, see Figure 1 below). The principles of CQI involve using the PDSA cycles to continuously improve an aspect of practice.


*Residents may partake in CQI projects as a continuation of the R1 project or as a new project, where you gather data after implementing a quality improvement intervention and measure whether that intervention has had its desired effect in practice.

*Examples:
    -E.g. interviewing patient experience before and after implementation of increased time allocation in doctor’s office
    +E.g. number of healthcare associated infections before and after implementation of hand hygiene posters in hospital

The goal of CQI is to learn how to identify and address safety, efficiency and/or quality concerns in practice.

Eligible projects should meet all the requirements for a Resident Scholar Project (see Requirements) in addition to the following criteria.

    1. **Evidence-based:**A thorough health literature search must be undertaken to find evidence for and against the performance standard and the improvement plan. This evidence should be summarized in the written report.
    2. **Evaluative:**An evaluation of the Quality Improvement Project must be included. This means evaluating the practice before the improvement is implemented and repeating the evaluation at a reasonable time afterwards with a summary and comparison of the results.

**Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)**

To prevent HAI, the authors used the prioritization matrix to choose the hand-hygiene compliance project. Consent was obtained from all the participants. Ethical clearance was obtained. The operational team comprised a pediatrician, medical officers, postgraduate students, nurse-in-charge, and two nursing officers. Baseline hand-hygiene compliance data were collected by the team leader during March. The HH techniques performed by the health care personnel during the five moments formed the baseline value (Table 1). The barriers that led to poor compliance with hand hygiene were identified using fishbone analysis, as shown in Fig. 1. These barriers and the baseline data were discussed with the team, and measures for improvement were laid out. The consultant (pediatrician) educated the health care personnel on the proper hand-hygiene practices in accordance with the WHO’s five moments of hand hygiene. A total of three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles were conducted from April to July 2021. The duration of the first two PDSA cycles was 4 wk and the last cycle was 6 wk. All the working staffs were advised to practise proper hand hygiene practices for a week prior to the start of the project. The posters depicting the five moments of hand hygiene and hand-hygiene techniques were pasted near the handwashing area and other important areas. A round-the-clock supply of nonmedicated liquid hand soap and autoclaved paper hand towels was ensured. Each bed was supplied with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. A detailed PDSA cycle intervention is depicted in Table 2.

This can be expected to be caused by"       Lack of staffing       Long shifts       Insufficient presence of positive role models       Lack of frequent team review meetings.  | Gaps and holes in the previous cycle are being addressed.

# Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)

In the healthcare system, there are always opportunities to optimize, streamline, develop and test processes. Quality improvement (QI) is a proven, effective way to improve care for patients, residents, and clients, and improve practice for staff[1]. QI utilizes structured improvement methods and models, such as Model for Improvement and a testing model called Plan-Do-Study-Act[2] (PDSA, see Figure 1 below). The principles of CQI involve using the PDSA cycles to continuously improve an aspect of practice.


*Residents may partake in CQI projects as a continuation of the R1 project or as a new project, where you gather data after implementing a quality improvement intervention and measure whether that intervention has had its desired effect in practice.

*Examples:
    *E.g. interviewing patient experience before and after implementation of increased time allocation in doctor’s office
    *E.g. number of healthcare associated infections before and after implementation of hand hygiene posters in hospital

The goal of CQI is to learn how to identify and address safety, efficiency and/or quality concerns in practice.

Eligible projects should meet all the requirements for a Resident Scholar Project (see Requirements) in addition to the following criteria.

    1. **Evidence-based:**A thorough health literature search must be undertaken to find evidence for and against the performance standard and the improvement plan. This evidence should be summarized in the written report.
    1. **Evaluative:**An evaluation of the Quality Improvement Project must be included. This means evaluating the practice before the improvement is implemented and repeating the evaluation at a reasonable time afterwards with a summary and comparison of the results.


[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_C0A5zX-iqM" %}

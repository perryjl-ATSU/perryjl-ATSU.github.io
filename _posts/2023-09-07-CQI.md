# Continuous Quality Improvement (Continuous QI)

QI is an established approach used to improve the effectiveness of healthcare professionals and the quality of care delivered to patients, inmates, and clients (Kumar et al., 2022). Continuous QI seeks to educate healthcare professionals about identifying and resolving safety, effectiveness, and quality issues.
QI frequently employs structured improvement methods and models such as the Model for Improvement and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model (see Figure 1). PDSA cycles are utilized to implement the principles of continuous quality improvement to a process, facilitating incremental enhancements.

It is recommended that three iterations of the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle be conducted (Arunakumar et al., 2023), as shown in the comprehensive PDSA cycle intervention outlined in Table 1. The average duration of the first two Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles is four weeks, but the last cycle may typically spans six weeks.

| **Act**                          | There is an anticipation for an improvement in hand hygiene compliance, a decrease in HAIs, and a generally positive response from the staff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | It is expected that there would be a decrease in hand hygiene compliance compared to the levels seen initially, leading to an increase in HAI.  This can be expected to be caused by"       Lack of staffing       Long shifts       Insufficient presence of positive role models       Lack of frequent team review meetings.  | Gaps and holes in the previous cycle are being addressed.  Feedback and modifications are being implemented.  All the staff sees the change positively                                   |   |

## Learning Objectives

Demonstrate the correct way to wash hands with soap and water according to the WHO-recommended method.

Discuss key issues and considerations of hand hygiene in a health care facility

Demonstrate the correct way to perform hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) according to the WHO-recommended method.

Identify the 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene.

Describe hand hygiene as a critical component of infection prevention and control

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

  <summary>The Purpose of Han Hygiene</summary>
  
In the health care environment microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, are transmitted through various routes. If not cleaned at the right moments, using the proper methods, the hands of HCWs play an important role in spreading microorganisms between patients. Timely hand hygiene also prevents contamination of the health care environment (e.g., linens, surfaces, patient care devices). The 5 Moments approach is designed to stop transmission at all of the key moments to keep patients safe.

During patient care, our hands become progressively colonized with microorganisms and potential pathogens. Lack of good hand hygiene increases the risk of contamination, and is a threat to patient safety. The purpose of good hand hygiene is to remove soil, organic material, and transient microorganisms from the hands. It does not eliminate the resident flora that live on the skin.

Hand hygiene is a general term that applies to either handwashing, handrubbing (e.g., using an alcohol-based hand rub), or surgical hand antisepsis. Hand hygiene is a simple but important procedure, yet its importance is often overlooked, even by HCWs. Timely and effective hand hygiene protects the patient, health care workers, and the health care environment from being contaminated by microorganisms that could be harmful pathogens.

By adhering to recommended hand hygiene practices, we can help protect patients by preventing infections from happening in the first place, and from spreading if they are already present. So, something that seems as simple as timely and effective hand hygiene can reduce the number of patients acquiring a health care-associated infection (HAI). Fewer HAIs means fewer resources spent on treating infections that could have been prevented, and ultimately, less morbidity and death. Fewer HAIs also reduces antibiotic use, which contributes to decreased antibiotic resistance. Therefore, hand hygiene is an essential health care intervention that saves both lives and money!

Now that you have learned about the role hand hygiene plays in limiting the spread of microorganisms, you decide to re-emphasize the purpose of hand hygiene with the surgical ward staff.

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

  <summary>The Purpose of Han Hygiene</summary>
  
In the health care environment microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, are transmitted through various routes. If not cleaned at the right moments, using the proper methods, the hands of HCWs play an important role in spreading microorganisms between patients. Timely hand hygiene also prevents contamination of the health care environment (e.g., linens, surfaces, patient care devices). The 5 Moments approach is designed to stop transmission at all of the key moments to keep patients safe.

During patient care, our hands become progressively colonized with microorganisms and potential pathogens. Lack of good hand hygiene increases the risk of contamination, and is a threat to patient safety. The purpose of good hand hygiene is to remove soil, organic material, and transient microorganisms from the hands. It does not eliminate the resident flora that live on the skin.

Hand hygiene is a general term that applies to either handwashing, handrubbing (e.g., using an alcohol-based hand rub), or surgical hand antisepsis. Hand hygiene is a simple but important procedure, yet its importance is often overlooked, even by HCWs. Timely and effective hand hygiene protects the patient, health care workers, and the health care environment from being contaminated by microorganisms that could be harmful pathogens.

By adhering to recommended hand hygiene practices, we can help protect patients by preventing infections from happening in the first place, and from spreading if they are already present. So, something that seems as simple as timely and effective hand hygiene can reduce the number of patients acquiring a health care-associated infection (HAI). Fewer HAIs means fewer resources spent on treating infections that could have been prevented, and ultimately, less morbidity and death. Fewer HAIs also reduces antibiotic use, which contributes to decreased antibiotic resistance. Therefore, hand hygiene is an essential health care intervention that saves both lives and money!

Now that you have learned about the role hand hygiene plays in limiting the spread of microorganisms, you decide to re-emphasize the purpose of hand hygiene with the surgical ward staff.

  <summary>Cleaning Hands with Alcohol-based Hand Rub</summary>
  
Alcohol-based hand rub is the preferred choice for hand hygiene if hands are not visibly soiled, because ABHR is more effective in killing microorganisms than plain or antimicrobial soaps and water, and it has other big advantages. The alcohol in ABHR kills microorganisms by denaturing proteins (i.e., they dissolve some microbe components). It also has persistent activity, meaning that it takes longer for microorganisms to repopulate the hands.

Hand hygiene with ABHR has advantages over hand hygiene with soap and water, including:

It takes less time—only 20 to 30 seconds. In a very busy work environment, ABHR can save you time!
ABHR can be placed directly at the point of care, making it convenient and easy to perform hand hygiene within your clinical workflow.
Hand hygiene with ABHR does not need sinks, water, or towels—hands are air-dried.
It is important to note that the active ingredient—alcohol—is flammable, and that you should be careful and make sure any ABHR is stored away from flames.

  <summary>5 Moments for Hand Hygiene</summary>
  
Health care workers should perform hand hygiene according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene. The WHO 5 Moments focuses on contact occurring within the patient zone during the delivery of patient care. It proposes a unified vision for all HCWs, trainers and observers to improve understanding of when to clean hands. It merges all hand hygiene indications recommended by the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care and CDC’s Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health Care Settings into five moments when hand hygiene is required. Importantly, this user- and patient-centred approach aims for ease of use and integration into the natural workflow, which applies across a wide range of care settings and health care professions.

  <summary>Gloves and Hand Hygiene (5 min)</summary>
  
Glove use is an important part of protecting hands from contamination. If an HCW is wearing gloves, it does NOT mean that hand hygiene can be skipped. In other words, glove use does NOT replace the need for hand hygiene. Considerations for hand hygiene and glove use include:

Gloves are worn when contact is anticipated with blood or other body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, potentially infectious material, or chemicals (such as cleaning solutions).
Hand hygiene is performed before putting on gloves.
Remove gloves after caring for a patient. Do not wear the same pair of gloves for the care of more than one patient.
When wearing gloves, remove gloves and perform hand hygiene during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to another body site that is not contaminated (including a mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or a medical device within the same patient or the environment). An example of this is performing a wound dressing (non-intact skin) on the abdomen and then performing phlebotomy on the arm.
Perform hand hygiene after glove removal. It is important to know that hand contamination often occurs during glove removal due to poor technique and also, possibly, as a result of small, undetected holes in gloves. Hands that are not clean when reaching into a box of gloves can spread microorganisms throughout the glove box. This is one reason why hand hygiene should always be performed before putting on and after taking off gloves.

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

  <summary>The Purpose of Hand Hygiene</summary>
  
Pathogens, viruses, and fungi may spread faster in healthcare settings if healthcare workers don't wash their hands well enough. The goal of the five-situations approach is to keep patients safe and stop them from being moved at crucial times. Hand cleanliness, like washing one's hands, rubbing one's hands, and using medical hand antisepsis, is very important for keeping patients safe and avoiding illnesses.

Hand cleanliness means removing dirt, dead skin, and temporary germs from the hands while leaving the natural flora alone. If there are infections, washing one's hands in a certain way can help stop them from getting worse and spreading. This could lower the number of health-care-associated illnesses (HAIs), which would save money on treating diseases that could have been avoided, lower the number of people who get sick or die, and lower the number of antibiotics people take, lowering drug resistance.

By lowering the amount of people who get HAIs, lowering drug use, and lowering antibiotic resistance, following hand cleanliness guidelines could save lives and money. Staff on the surgery ward must be told of how important it is to clean their hands to keep patients safe and stop the spread of disease.

  <summary>Proper Hand Cleaning with Alcohol-based Hand Rub </summary>
  
Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) is a widely used method of hand hygiene due to its effective germ elimination and long-lasting properties. The structure of proteins is altered by ABHR, which helps prevent their inactivation and transfer onto hands. Using ABHR is a convenient option for busy workplaces, as it only takes 20-30 seconds. It does not require additional space, pots, water, or clothing and can be placed directly where care is provided. Alcohol is a highly flammable substance and should always be kept at a safe distance from any open flames. Using ABHR at the point of care could potentially decrease wait times.

The importance of hand hygiene in a hospital setting is highlighted by the 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene. The aim of this united vision is to increase awareness among people about the appropriate times to wash their hands in five settings. The strategy aims to prioritize the needs of both users and patients, ensuring effectiveness in various care settings and among healthcare professionals. It also emphasizes seamless integration into existing processes.

  <summary>Gloves and Hand Hygiene</summary>
  
To minimize the risk of contracting illnesses, it is recommended to use gloves in addition to regular hand washing. Gloves are necessary to prevent contamination from blood, bodily fluids, mucosal membranes, damaged skin, infectious materials, and chemicals. Prior to interacting with a patient, it is essential to wash hands and wear gloves, which should be properly removed afterward. Using only one pair of gloves per person is insufficient. It is advisable to wash hands when transitioning between uncontaminated areas of the body, such as after performing procedures like phlebotomy on the arm followed by a wound dressing on the stomach. To prevent contamination resulting from improper technique or undetectable cracks in gloves, it is crucial to wash hands regularly after removing them. It is important to clean hands both before and after wearing gloves to prevent the transmission of germs.

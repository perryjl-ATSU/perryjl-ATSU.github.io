## The Story of Ignaz Semmelweis

During the 1800s, Ignaz Phillip Semmelweis played a significant role in establishing handwashing as a standard practice in modern medicine (Kadar, 2019). In 1842, while working at Vienna General Hospital, he observed a significant difference in mortality rates between the first clinic, which had a mortality rate of 15.8%, and the second clinic, which had a death rate of 7.6% (Kadar, 2019). The increased mortality rate was believed to be caused by purpureal sepsis, commonly known as "child-bed fever."

## Why Is This Story Important?

Louis Pasteur's germ theory, developed in the 1860s, and Robert Koch's postulates, established in 1890, validated the claims made by Ignaz Semmelweis (Poczai & Karvalics, 202). For decades, both hospitals and nursing homes have relied on the well-established practice of frequent handwashing as a crucial measure in infection prevention. It is impossible to predict the number of lives that could have been saved if this basic policy had been adopted and implemented earlier.

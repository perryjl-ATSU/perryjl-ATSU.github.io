## HAI Introduction

According to Haque et al. (2018), healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) directly result from receiving medical care. Individuals who use medical equipment such as catheters, ventilators, or central lines or have undergone surgical procedures are susceptible to developing HAIs. According to a study conducted by Haque et al. in 2020, although HAIs continue to be a significant problem, the study found that the majority of these infections can be prevented. Over the last ten years, there has been significant growth in the prevention and control of HAIs due to various incentives such as legislative, regulatory, and organizational measures (Haque et al., 2018). These shifts in healthcare professionals' conduct have not successfully bridged the gap between clinical practice and the scientific evidence base. 

## Hand hygiene

Maintaining good hand hygiene, such as routine hand washing, may prevent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and HAIs in the simplest and most affordable methods possible. By frequently washing their hands, healthcare personnel may successfully stop the spread of microorganisms, particularly types resistant to antibiotics. 
The 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene approach (Smith et al., 2019) is advised by the World Health Organization (WHO) for healthcare workers. This approach suggests washing hands before engaging in clean or aseptic operations after patient contact (i.e., bodily fluids, patient belongings, etc.).
Despite the critical role of hand hygiene in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, numerous healthcare facilities worldwide still struggle to implement it effectively. Unfortunately, only a few hospitals and clinics rigorously adhere to hand-washing regulations. The cleanliness of a person's hands reflects their knowledge, attitude, and behavior towards preventing and managing illnesses.

## Environmental hygiene

In hospitals, infection control is highly dependent on maintaining a clean and sanitary environment. According to a study conducted by Russotto et al. (2023), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a drug-resistant bacteria, and pathogens are usually spread in hospitals as a result of unclean surfaces. To minimize the risk of infection, both patients and medical workers should refrain from coming into contact with dirty surfaces and instruments. Evidence suggests that hospitals are common sites for the transmission of nosocomial infections, particularly through surfaces, medical equipment, and water systems. Healthcare facilities experience several crucial moments in their complex reality. Medical personnel, visitors, and patients are all equally vulnerable to contracting viruses and bacteria. The goal of environmental hygiene is to minimize the presence of infectious agents on surfaces in order to reduce the transmission of diseases. 

## Surveillance

Measure the local burden of HAIs and AMR to identify outbreaks and clusters using surveillance systems, which are also well-known for their involvement in early HAI detection. Tools for tracking HAIs are essential for national and local programs aimed at preventing and controlling infections. The public health system in a country needs a nationwide monitoring technique. However, new information gleaned reveals that monitoring is challenging in many locations due to issues with infrastructure, data management, and lab capacity (Wang et al., 2021).

## Antibiotic stewardship

To effectively address AMR, it is imperative to implement efficient strategies that prioritize infection control and the prevention of resistant germ transmission among patients. These measures are essential components of a comprehensive plan designed to address AMR. Managing AMR in hospitals and acute care settings necessitates the implementation of responsible antibiotic usage. Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives generally have a wide-ranging impact, influencing multiple species simultaneously. These initiatives aim to address the issue of antibiotic resistance and prioritize the prevention of horizontal transmission.
